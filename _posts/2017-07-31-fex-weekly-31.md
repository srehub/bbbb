**React 16 beta**  
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10294  
React 16 is the first release that ships with a rewrite of the React core (previously codenamed "Fiber"). This initial React 16.0 release is mostly focused on compatibility with existing apps. It does not enable asynchronous rendering yet. We will introduce an opt-in to the async mode later during React 16.x. 另附：[Error Handling in React 16](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html), [Top Resources to Explore React Fiber](https://hackernoon.com/top-resources-to-explore-react-fiber-9a2b19114520).

**A new V8 is coming, Node.js performance is changing**  
https://www.nearform.com/blog/node-js-is-getting-a-new-v8-with-turbofan/  
In recent years Matteo Collina and I have focused on finding out how to write performant Node.js code. Of course this means knowing which approaches are fast and which approaches are slow when our code is executed by the V8 JavaScript engine. Now it’s time for us to challenge all our assumptions about performance, because the V8 team has has written a new JIT Compiler: Turbofan.

**REST APIs are REST-in-Peace APIs. Long Live GraphQL**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/rest-apis-are-rest-in-peace-apis-long-live-graphql-d412e559d8e4  
After years of dealing with REST APIs, when I first learned about GraphQL and the problems it’s attempting to solve, I could not resist tweeting the exact title of this article.

**The Ultimate Guide to JavaScript Fatigue: Realities of our industry**  
http://lucasfcosta.com/2017/07/17/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-JavaScript-Fatigue.html  
Complaining about JS Fatigue is just like complaining about the fact that humanity has created too many tools to solve the problems we have, from email to airplanes and spaceships. My goal with this post is to change the way you think about software engineering in general and help you in any areas you might work on.

**Progressively Enhancing CSS Layout: From Floats To Flexbox To Grid**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/enhancing-css-layout-floats-flexbox-grid/  
Earlier this year, support for CSS grid layout landed in most major desktop browsers. Naturally, the specification is one of the hot topics at meet-ups and conferences. After having some conversations about grid and progressive enhancement, I believe that there’s a good amount of uncertainty about using it. I heard some quite interesting questions and statements, which I want to address in this post.

**QML vs. HTML5**  
http://blog.qt.io/blog/2017/07/28/qml-vs-html5/  
Mobile devices have set the standard in terms of responsiveness and user-friendliness for HMIs across industries. Manufacturers of cars, medical equipment, industrial automation systems and consumer electronics now want to replicate this great user experience for their embedded devices. To find out which technology strategy we should select we set up a test where one of our developers was allocated 160 hours to create a demo application of an embedded system using Qt & QML and same number of hours to create the very equivalent application using HTML5.

**[译]Dropbox公司的Go语言探索之路**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIwMzg1ODcwMw==&mid=2247486708&idx=1&sn=37e60bc058ad816cf9ccf527b806c507  
Go 语言高效、可扩展且极具生产能力。一部分程序员乐于加以运用，但也有一些人认为其难以理解甚至非常无聊。不可否认的是，Go 在具体实践中确实为不少公司带来了好处，且让我们看看 Dropbox 公司的 Go 语言探索道路。

**[译]API 设计原则 - QT 设计实践总结**  
https://github.com/oldratlee/translations/blob/master/api-design-principles-from-qt/README.md  
Qt的设计水准在业界很有口碑，一致、易于掌握和强大的API是Qt最著名的优点之一。此文既是Qt官网上的API设计指导准则，也是Qt在API设计上的实践总结。虽然Qt用的是C++，但其中设计原则和思考是具有普适性的（如果你对C++还不精通，可以忽略与C++强相关或是过于细节的部分，仍然可以学习或梳理关于API设计最有价值的内容）。整个篇幅中有很多示例，是关于API设计一篇难得的好文章。

**[译]回顾 ESLint 的成功**  
https://github.com/xitu/gold-miner/blob/master/TODO/reflections-on-eslints-success.md  
我在 2013 年 6 月构思开发了 ESLint，7 月第一次对外发布。熟悉的读者可能还记得，ESLint 最初主要设计目标是运行时加载的检查工具（linter）。在工作中我看到我们的 JavaScript 代码中的一些问题，希望能有一些自动化的手段避免这些问题再次出现。在 ESLint 发布后的 2 年半里，它的受欢迎程度大大增加。所有这一切发生了，然而过去 2 年我患上了很严重的莱姆病，几乎无法离开我的房子。这意味着我不能够外出参加会议和聚会来宣传 ESLint（前 2 年我可是会议常客）。但不知为何，ESLint 获得了广泛关注，并且继续收到欢迎。我觉得是时候回顾其中缘由了。

性能问题依然很严重

**Starting the Avalanche - Application DDoS In Microservice Architectures**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/starting-the-avalanche-640e69b14a06  
In this blog post, we will discuss an effort at Netflix to identify, test, and remediate application layer DDoS attacks. We will begin with some background on the problem space. Next we will discuss the tools and methods we used to test our systems. Finally, we will discuss steps for making systems more resilient against application layer DDoS attacks.

**The Road to uChat_ Building Uber’s Internal Chat Solution**  
https://eng.uber.com/uchat/  
So after testing multiple off-the-shelf alternatives, we built uChat, our custom in-house messaging platform, by leveraging open source platform Mattermost and Puppet, the Uber standard for deployment configuration management. In this article, we discuss how in just three months our team transitioned the company to a new solution capable of reliably delivering over one million messages per day to tens of thousands of users, all in one unified chat environment.

**The MDN Redesign “Behind the Scenes”**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/07/the-mdn-redesign-behind-the-scenes/  
Kuma, the code that produces the MDN site, is a weird mix of the old and the new. MDN turned ten in 2015 and there’s still code and content around from those very first days. When I sat down to start coding the current redesign, the first thing I did was remove the last few traces of the last redesign. One of the ways we deal with old code in kuma is with the campsite rule: Always leave your campsite better than you found it. A redesign touches a lot of files, and this was a great opportunity to clean up and refactor — at least until the deadline started getting close.

**LinkedIn Passes IPv6 Milestone**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/07/linkedin-passes-ipv6-milestone  
Earlier this month, and for the first time in our company’s history, more than 50% of pages on LinkedIn were accessed over IPv6 from mobile devices in the U.S.

**Why Composition is Harder with Classes**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-composition-is-harder-with-classes-c3e627dcd0aa  
ES6 includes a convenient class syntax, so you may be wondering why we should care about factories at all. All of that implies that, unlike factory functions, classes are not a good solution for composing functional mixins. You can still achieve composition using class, but it’s a much more complex process, and as you’ll see, the additional costs are usually not worth the extra effort.

**How do I know if I’m good at programming**  
http://www.danielslater.net/2017/07/how-do-i-know-if-im-good-at-programming.html  
So how do I know if I’m good at programming? A good place to start is to ask “what is good code?”. If a programmer can’t produce good code, they aren’t a good programmer.

**A story about how I tried to get into game development and failed**  
http://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2017/07/17/a-story-about-how-i-tried-to-get-into-game-development-and-failed/  
If you read this blog regularly, you know that I usually write about DDD, functional programming, and enterprise software development best practices in general. These are the techniques I enjoy talking about, as well as applying them in my own projects. However, there was another field I always wanted to try myself in. That is game development. The ability to write my own games was the reason why I started learning to program in the first place. And I believe many programmers had this motivation behind their careers as well.

**Should the ‘KEG’ Stack Replace the LAMP Stack?**  
https://thenewstack.io/keg-stack-replace-lamp-stack/  
For years, the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) has been an oasis for developers looking to build modern apps without getting locked into the desert of some big vendor’s ecosystem. Here’s a snapshot of what a new LAMP stack might look like today if we recast it with more modern tools and frameworks: Kubernetes Replaces Both Linux and Apache, Etcd (Maybe) Replaces MySQL, Go Replaces Python. 另附：[How does enterprise-ready Kubernetes transform software delivery](https://coreos.com/blog/kubernetes-tectonic-customers-tell-all)

一夜之间，互联网上[大家都在想念我](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JBgbjY6XlOP2uhyPBRxpnA)，弄的我好像怎么了似的。如果不出来回复下，好像我就真的怎么了似的。其实我知道，大家也不是想念我，是想念讲真话的人，是想念挑战者，也是想念互联网的炮火声。创业阶层固化只是短期现象，长远看，任何阶层都会被打破的。创业者们不需要担心的是，站队也好，插旗子也好，都阻止不了格局被打破。互联网发展中，真正能够阻止格局被打破，或者能够打破格局的，应该是创新。

## 深阅读

**什么才是你心目中的前端圈**  
https://www.zhihu.com/question/59758480  
这是个好话题，大家回答有助于我们更好地认识前端。

**Announcing the new webpack CLI**  
https://medium.com/webpack/announcing-the-new-webpack-cli-75ce1d9b8663  
After getting feedback from the community about webpack being hard to get started with, we listened and decided to re-envision the CLI for webpack. Although much of the logic from the old CLI was kept, a set of new features have been added: init and migrate.

**Here comes Treble: A modular base for Android**  
https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html  
On the Android team, we view each dessert release as an opportunity to make Android better for our users and our ecosystem partners. One thing we've consistently heard from our device-maker partners is that updating existing devices to a new version of Android is incredibly time consuming and costly. With Android O, we've been working very closely with device makers and silicon manufacturers to take steps toward solving this problem, and we're excited to give you a sneak peek at Project Treble, the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date.

**Writing Secure Node.js Code**  
https://community.risingstack.com/writing-secure-node-js-code-danny-grander/

**Keeping the Node.js core small**  
https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/keeping-the-node-js-core-small-137f83d18152  
My hope is that people will look more critically at new feature proposals, and also consider how many of their own personal annoyances with the Node.js API (you know you have them!) would have been easily fixable if the API had been published as a well-managed npm package.

**Quantum Up Close: What is a browser engine?**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/05/quantum-up-close-what-is-a-browser-engine/  
We actually shipped our first significant piece of Quantum just last month with Firefox 53. But, we realize that for people who don’t build web browsers, it can be hard to see just why some of the changes we’re making to Firefox are so significant. With this in mind, we’re kicking off a series of blog posts to provide a deeper look at just what it is we’re doing with Project Quantum. We hope that this series of posts will give you a better understanding of how Firefox works, and the ways in which Firefox is building a next-generation browser engine made to take better advantage of modern computer hardware.

**An Abridged Cartoon Introduction To WebAssembly**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/abridged-cartoon-introduction-webassembly/  
There’s a lot of hype about WebAssembly in JavaScript circles today. People talk about how blazingly fast it is, and how it’s going to revolutionize web development. But most conversations don’t go into the details of why it’s fast. In this article, I want to help you understand what exactly it is about WebAssembly that makes it fast.

**混搭人文主义，我找到了数据可视化的新玩法**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xu6R7ta4OFeG4jMoDIPs1g  
在习惯了获取数据、分析数据、得出结论，并且可视化的流程后，我们开始思考这么做的意义究竟是什么？仅仅是为了得出某个结论吗？这个结论和现实的出入又代表了什么？我们能否探究得出数据的本质？TED 嘉宾Giorgia Lupi经由她的个人经历，为大家介绍她的别样数据可视化之旅，看看是不是能给我们一些新的不一样的启发呢？

**The End of Web Forms**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/end-of-web-forms-conversational-uis-chatbots  
Web forms are annoying, inefficient and they fill people with dread. Does anybody actually like filling out web forms? Nevertheless, they are a “necessary evil” that can make or break some of the most critical online interactions. Web forms are still mostly based on old paper forms—zombie leftovers of system-centric UIs (vs. user-centric). It’s been thirty years and we’re still typing the same information into forms over and over again.

**Have Web Standards on Mobile Caught Up to Phonegap in 2017**  
http://developer.telerik.com/topics/mobile-development/have-web-standards-on-mobile-caught-up-to-phonegap-in-2017/  
In this article I'm going to look at the list of core plugins supported by PhoneGap/Cordova and discuss their status in terms of pure web browser support. I'll also touch on a few other items outside that core list as well. Obviously there's more than what I'll be covering here, but the idea is to take stock of where we are, where we're heading, and plan for the future.

**为什么我们有必要重新思考和定义“运营”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI2NTY4MDg1NA==&mid=2247486939&idx=1&sn=2ad1d490bc08024f6098811ad4c4c9ee  
三节课的一次线上课程的总结。在这个时代，我们应该重新审视和思考“运营”这件事，赋予它一个更加清晰的定义。在写作《运营之光》这本书的前后，我对此进行了大量思考，这些思考不见得一定对，但在我看来，它是能够有助于降低上面提到的那些迷茫和困扰的。在此，我愿意把它分享出来，希望能得到更多人的拍砖与交流，也希望可以给大家带来一些启发。以下，我会分六部分来阐述我的思考。

**为互联网原住民设计产品的思考**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwODY4OTk2Mg==&mid=2652043427&idx=1&sn=c09c9c69903bf9a5ab19896122e4c7c3  
对于数字时代的原住民（从小生活在各种电子计算设备之中）而言，后果往往复杂得多，因为他们的身份和沟通方式会被这种环境塑造。这就是设计师面临的挑战：我们要如何为一个自己都还没有完全理解的新世界建立一个负责而有效的生态系统？我们可以从学习这种全新文化的语言入手。通过真正理解我们的数字空间中的行为模式转变和语言演变，我们可以针对目前发现的问题进行恰当的设计工作，并获得预见未来事物的能力。

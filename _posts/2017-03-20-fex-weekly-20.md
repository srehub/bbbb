**Announcing Guetzli: A New Open Source JPEG Encoder**  
https://research.googleblog.com/2017/03/announcing-guetzli-new-open-source-jpeg.html  
At Google, we care about giving users the best possible online experience, both through our own services and products and by contributing new tools and industry standards for use by the online community. That’s why we’re excited to announce Guetzli, a new open source algorithm that creates high quality JPEG images with file sizes 35% smaller than currently available methods, enabling webmasters to create webpages that can load faster and use even less data. [译文](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5Nzc4OTA1Mw==&mid=2659599074&idx=1&sn=a26ae2a8becdc1f2cfbddf44d8ca1495)。

**Three challenges for the web, according to its inventor**  
http://webfoundation.org/2017/03/web-turns-28-letter/  
Today marks 28 years since I submitted my original proposal for the worldwide web. But over the past 12 months, I’ve become increasingly worried about three new trends, which I believe we must tackle in order for the web to fulfill its true potential as a tool that serves all of humanity:  1) We’ve lost control of our personal data; 2) It’s too easy for misinformation to spread on the web; 3) Political advertising online needs transparency and understanding.

**A formal spec for GitHub Flavored Markdown**  
https://githubengineering.com/a-formal-spec-for-github-markdown/  
https://github.github.com/gfm/  
We’re hoping to improve on this situation by releasing a formal specification of the syntax for GitHub Flavored Markdown, and its corresponding reference implementation. This formal specification is based on CommonMark, an ambitious project to formally specify the Markdown syntax used by many websites on the internet in a way that reflects its real world usage.

**Getting Started with CSS Grid**  
https://css-tricks.com/getting-started-css-grid/  
CSS Grid is the first real layout system for the web. It's designed for organizing content both into columns and rows and it finally gives developers almost God-like control of the screens before us. That means that we can finally ditch decades of hacks and workarounds for setting elements on a web page – ultimately it means that complex layouts and beautifully typeset pages are now not only possible but easy and maintainable. 另附：[How to Order and Align Items in Grid Layout](https://www.sitepoint.com/order-align-items-grid-layout/)。还不知道 CSS Grid 的请移步 Webkit 对它的介绍：[CSS Grid Layout: A New Layout Module for the Web](https://webkit.org/blog/7434/css-grid-layout-a-new-layout-module-for-the-web/)

**Android热更新方案Robust开源，新增自动化补丁工具**  
http://tech.meituan.com/android_autopatch.html  
Robust热更新系统借鉴Instant Run原理，实现了一个兼容性更强而且实时生效的热更新方案。其基本思路是，Robust热更新系统在一个方法的入口处插入一段跳转代码，当发现某个方法出现bug就跳转执行补丁中的代码，略过原有代码的执行，否则执行原有方法体逻辑。Robust凭借着自身的优势，已经在美团点评各个团队得到了快速普及。

**写在 Element 一周年之际**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25739512  
Element 伴随着开发团队的成长而壮大，它可能是 Vue 2 最有名的组件库，但要想做到 Top 1，或者保持 Top 1，我们还需要加倍努力。当然，Element 一路走来，跟公司的支持密不可分，饿了么大前端团队在未来还会提供更多更好用、好玩、有趣的东西给大家，我们始终坚持开源精神，不忘初心。另附：[如何落地和管理一个“大前端”团队?饿了么大前端团队解密](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2650995610&idx=1&sn=d44ad482dc30a3eae727571f2630a348)、[PWA 在饿了么的实践](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25800461)

像 Dropbox 这样的 SaaS 公司需要持续升级迭代他们的系统，并且这会涉及整个架构栈的所有层。当需要调整某些基础架构，发布一个新功能，或是设置 A/B 测试时，最重要的是我们如何快速变更并体现在产品中。

**Scrolling on the web: A primer**  
https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/03/08/scrolling-on-the-web/  
Scrolling is one of the oldest interactions on the web. Long before we had pull-to-refresh or infinite-loading lists, the humble scrollbar solved the web’s original scaling problem: how can we interact with content that’s stretched beyond the available viewport?

**Common Async/Await Design Patterns in Node.js**  
http://thecodebarbarian.com/common-async-await-design-patterns-in-node.js.html  
Async/await in Node.js opens up a host of powerful design patterns. Tasks that used to take complex libraries or intricate promise chaining can now be done with rudimentary if statements and for loops. I already wrote about these kind of design patterns with co, but async/await makes these patterns accessible in vanilla Node.js, no outside libraries required.

**The Evolution of JavaScript Modularity**

And meanwhile we will restore historical context of their emergence.

**Golden Guidelines for Writing Clean CSS**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/golden-guidelines-for-writing-clean-css/  
As mentioned, there are some rules for writing clean CSS that you should try your best to avoid breaking. They’ll help you write CSS that is lightweight and reusable: Avoid global and element selectors; Omit overly specific selectors; Use semantic class names; Don’t tie CSS too closely to markup structure.

**Writing a JavaScript Framework - Client-Side Routing**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/writing-a-javascript-framework-client-side-routing/  
This is the last chapter of the Writing a JavaScript framework series. In this chapter, I am going to discuss how client-side routing in JavaScript differs from server-side routing and why should it be treated differently. The series is about an open-source client-side framework, called NX. During the series, I explain the main difficulties I had to overcome while writing the framework.

**Lean Inception**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/lean-inception/  
Agile projects emphasize the early and continuous delivery of valuable software, whose value comes from business objectives and the needs of customers. Lean StartUp product creation helps this by promoting the incremental release of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) — a simple version of a product that is given to users in order to validate the key business assumptions.

**Teams and the Way They Work**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/teams-way-work  
As soon as the job gets large enough, we need more than one person. People are great, however each person is unique, with a different skillset, knowledge base, history, value system and wants and needs. It is only when there is clear direction, shared desire to succeed, and clear boundaries that they will thrive and flourish.

**透明，真实，自组织**  
http://www.iheima.com/zixun/2017/0317/161923.shtml  
透明、真实、自组织，这些移动产品上的关键词，是否可以也作为高科技企业的组织文化理念？腾讯联合创始人、前CTO、腾讯学院荣誉院长张志东(Tony)，在2017腾讯HR内部年会中分享到：保持独立思考，尝试更开放的思想，把更多的精力放在创造具有内生力的智慧支撑平台上。

**吴穹：既然没有退路，创新转型不可避免**  
http://www.ituring.com.cn/article/274562  
创业圆梦、创新转型已经成为许多人精神上的一剂鸦片，好像只要还在创业、创新，那些关于未来的美好幻象就永远不会消失。 全民逐浪的游戏里，少数成功者登至浪潮顶端，风光无限，而那些曾全力追赶浪潮，最后仍被浪潮吞噬的“失败者”沉默得就像从未出现过。致力于推广“精益敏捷”创新思想的吴穹，告诉我们创新并非一场赌博，全靠运气，它有法可循。

**给碎片化学习泼点冷水**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MDMwOTcwMg==&mid=2650004789&idx=1&sn=db923025f969e2bcc9813a912f150ac1  
学习的使命之一就是不断反思，永远保持怀疑和批判的精神。即便你已经从碎片化学习中受益良多，如果你仍然单纯享受碎片化学习中一阵阵“爽”的感觉，或者全然相信某些人兜售的碎片化学习资料，那么，你距离真正的学习还有挺长的距离。你正在的这期 Weekly 其实也是碎片化知识，只能帮你解决“信息 & 知道”的问题，真正要掌握技术，光靠这些远远不够，必须系统化地看书、看论文、看源代码，在编码实践中持续寻找解决问题的最佳方式，只有这样才能成为专业码农。

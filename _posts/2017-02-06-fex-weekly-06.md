**Google Computer Science Education**  
https://www.google.com/edu/cs/index.html  
Computer science (CS) education is a pathway to innovation, to creativity and to exciting career opportunities. We believe that all students deserve these opportunities. That is why Google is committed to developing programs, resources, tools and community partnerships which make CS engaging and accessible for all students.

**[译]热闹驱动开发**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MDMwOTcwMg==&mid=2650004762&idx=1&sn=b977fae06fdf6f7a39909e956d07085a  
软件开发团队关于软件架构或技术栈的决策，很多并不是基于扎实的研究和对期望效果的认真思考，而是不准确的意见、社交媒体的信息，或者就些是“热门”玩意。这种做派的危害我见过不少，称它为“热闹驱动开发（Hype Driven Development，HDD）”。我赞成的是更专业的做法，称之为“脚踏实地的软件工程”。下面一起看看HDD的来龙去脉，想想我们能怎么改进。另附：[技术选型最怕的是什么](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5Nzc4OTA1Mw==&mid=2659598936&idx=1&sn=ef5bc2cd7e7b27c19b8fa074891ee5e5)

**Front-End Developer Handbook 2017**  
https://frontendmasters.gitbooks.io/front-end-handbook-2017/content/  
The content of the handbook favors web technologies (HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript) and those solutions that are directly built on top of these open technologies. The materials referenced and discussed in the book are either best in class or the current offering to a problem. The book should not be considered a comprehensive outline of all resources available to a front-end developer. The value of the book is tied up in a terse, focused, and timely curation of just enough categorical information so as not to overwhelm anyone on any one particular subject matter.

**Announcing GVFS (Git Virtual File System)**  
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2017/02/03/announcing-gvfs-git-virtual-file-system/  
Today, we’re introducing GVFS (Git Virtual File System), which virtualizes the file system beneath your repo and makes it appear as though all the files in your repo are present, but in reality only downloads a file the first time it is opened. GVFS also actively manages how much of the repo Git has to consider in operations like checkout and status, since any file that has not been hydrated can be safely ignored. And because we do this all at the file system level, your IDEs and build tools don’t need to change at all!

**Building Zero protocol for fast, secure mobile connections**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/608854979307125/building-zero-protocol-for-fast-secure-mobile-connections/  
Over the past year, we've built and deployed Zero protocol to our mobile apps and load balancers. We've seen performance improvements that include a 41 percent reduction in connection latency and 2 percent reduction in total request time. We've learned several practical engineering lessons about the trade-offs associated with 0-RTT protocols, such as API design, security properties, and deployment, and have contributed some of our findings to TLS 1.3, which is now near maturity. We hope the lessons we share here are applicable to apps that will deploy TLS 1.3 in the future.

**Why 2016 Was the Best Year Ever for Node.js**  
https://nodesource.com/blog/why-2016-was-the-best-year-ever-for-node-js-node-by-numbers-2016  
Yes, that's right, I'm going to argue that 2016 was our best year ever, and may go down as the most important period in the history of Node.js, backed by some hard numbers from this year's [Node by Numbers](https://nodesource.com/node-by-numbers)

**JavaScript Will Finally Get Proper Asynchronous Programming**  
http://thenewstack.io/async-officially-coming-javascript-year/  
The proposal to include async function in ECMAScript has reached stage four; that means it’s on track to be in the 2017 release of the standard. But what does that mean for JavaScript developers?

**CQRS Explained - Node.js at Scale**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/cqrs-explained-node-js-at-scale/  
CQRS is an architectural pattern, where the acronym stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. We can talk about CQRS when the data read operations are separated from the data write operations, and they happen on a different interface. In most of the CQRS systems, read and write operations use different data models, sometimes even different data stores. This kind of segregation makes it easier to scale, read and write operations and to control security - but adds extra complexity to your system.

**Introducing Lottie**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/introducing-lottie-4ff4a0afac0e#.n5pgc22dj  
[Lottie](http://airbnb.design/lottie/) is an iOS, Android, and React Native library that renders After Effects animations in real time, and allows native apps to use animations as easily as they use static assets.

**Everything you need to know about HTTP security headers**  
https://blog.appcanary.com/2017/http-security-headers.html  
This article explains what secure headers are and how to implement these headers in Rails, Django, Express.js, Go, Nginx, and Apache.

**下一代 Web 应用模型 —— Progressive Web App**  
http://geek.csdn.net/news/detail/135595  
2016年，Google提出了PWA，志在增强Web体验。可显著提高加载速度、可离线工作、可被添加至主屏、全屏执行、推送通知消息……等等这些特性可使Web应用渐进式地变成App，甚至与APP相匹敌。这一系列特性背后有哪些核心关键技术支撑，本文将为您一一分析，解开它的神秘面纱。

**Why I created junctions.js**

Junctions is a new, composable alternative to react-router.

**What happens when you use RxJS in React?**  
https://hackernoon.com/what-happens-when-you-use-rxjs-in-react-11ae5163fc0a#.jlru5uko6  
The ReactiveX Observable model allows you to treat streams of asynchronous events with the same sort of simple, composable operations that you use for collections of data items like arrays. It frees you from tangled webs of callbacks, and thereby makes your code more readable and less prone to bugs.

**Crash Course: UI Design**  
https://medium.com/hh-design/crash-course-ui-design-25d13ff60962#.75ndc967f  
At their most simple forms, UX design is what makes an interface useful, and UI design is what makes an interface beautiful. For UI, this includes a blend of visual hierarchy and interface elements. To understand what separates a great interface from a good interface, one must understand the UI design is merely just one layer of the entire design process. Perhaps this is why people often confuse UX and UI. In the following few paragraphs, however, I hope to help you as the audience or reader understand where the differences lie in the context of the design process.

**Open-sourcing Chrome on iOS!**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2017/01/open-sourcing-chrome-on-ios.html  
Historically, the code for Chrome for iOS was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform. After years of careful refactoring, all of this code is rejoining Chromium and being moved into the [open-source repository](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/ios/).  
Chrome 近期会推出这个功能：[Integrating Progressive Web Apps deeply into Android](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/02/integrating-progressive-web-apps-deeply.htm)

**GitLab.com Database Incident**  
https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/  
We had a serious incident with one of our databases. We lost six hours of database data (issues, merge requests, users, comments, snippets, etc.) for GitLab.com. Git/wiki repositories and self-hosted installations were not affected. Losing production data is unacceptable and in a few days we'll publish a post on why this happened and a list of measures we will implement to prevent it happening again.

**新时代的知识演绎者们**  
https://www.huxiu.com/article/179893.html  
并非是不存在能够解决问题的知识，而是这些知识没有被很好的组织起来，形成更加实用、易于理解的形式。如果有一个专业的团队，帮助用户从各种资料中，找到答案，并加工成更易理解和使用的形式呢？可能每个人只需要花费20分钟以内的时间就可以解决自己的问题。所以关于知识类产品的一个机会是，在现在的时代背景下我们似乎缺少知识的“演绎者”。

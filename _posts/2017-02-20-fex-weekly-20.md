**High-performance ES2015 and beyond**  
https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/02/high-performance-es2015-and-beyond.html  
Over the last couple of months the V8 team focused on bringing the performance of newly added ES2015 and other even more recent JavaScript features on par with their transpiled ES5 counterparts.

**Introducing Cloud Spanner: a global database service for mission-critical applications**  
https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/02/introducing-Cloud-Spanner-a-global-database-service-for-mission-critical-applications.html  
http://developers.googleblog.cn/2017/02/tensorflow-10.html  
We’re excited to announce the public beta for Cloud Spanner, a globally distributed relational database service that lets customers have their cake and eat it too: ACID transactions and SQL semantics, without giving up horizontal scaling and high availability.

**Announcing TensorFlow 1.0**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-tensorflow-10.html  
We're announcing TensorFlow 1.0: It's faster; It's more flexible; It's more production-ready than ever. 另附： [Yahoo supercharges TensorFlow with Apache Spark](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/yahoo-supercharges-tensorflow-with-apache-spark/)

**JavaScript’s Journey through 2016**  
http://developer.telerik.com/topics/web-development/javascripts-journey-2016/  
Every year there seems to be more and more ways to use JavaScript and 2016 turned out to be no different. Dependent on your level of optimism this can be extremely exciting or extremely confusing. Last year we made some predictions about JavaScript in 2016. Now, I'll look back to to see if our predictions held true or went the way of the political pundits. Then I'll use what we've learned this year to make an educated guess on what we'll get out of 2017.

**Base64 Encoding & Performance**  
https://csswizardry.com/2017/02/base64-encoding-and-performance/  
One of the touted ‘best practices’ born of this advice was the adoption of Base64 encoding: the act of taking an external asset (e.g. an image) and embedding it directly into the text-resource that would utilise it (e.g. a stylesheet). The upshot of which is that we reduce the number of HTTP requests, and that both assets (e.g. the stylesheet and the image) arrive at the same time. Sounds like a dream, right? Unfortunately Base64 encoding assets is very much an anti-pattern1. In this article I’m hoping to share some insights as to critical path optimisation, Gzip, and of course, Base64.

**An Update on ES6 Modules in Node.js**  
https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/an-update-on-es6-modules-in-node-js-42c958b890c#.7ha4c9vtc  
A few months ago I wrote an article describing the various differences that exist between Node.js CommonJS modules and the new ES6 Module system; and described a number of challenges inherent with implementing the new model in Node.js core. Here, I want to provide an update on how things are progressing.

**JAVASCRIPT WITHOUT LOOPS**  
http://jrsinclair.com/articles/2017/javascript-without-loops/  
We’ve been saying that control structures like loops introduce complexity. But so far we’ve not seen any evidence of how that happens. So let’s take a look at how loops in JavaScript work. In JavaScript we have at least four or five ways of looping.

**How to build cross-platform mobile apps using nothing more than a JSON markup**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-build-cross-platform-mobile-apps-using-nothing-more-than-a-json-markup-f493abec1873#.l9b4vcicx  
For the past few months, I’ve been working on a new way to build cross-platform, native iOS and Android apps called Jasonette. It lets you describe an entire app with nothing but a single JSON markup. If your app consists entirely of JSON, it can be treated like any other data. And it can be served remotely from the cloud on-demand.

**Managing State in Angular Applications**  
https://blog.nrwl.io/managing-state-in-angular-applications-22b75ef5625f#.tk9cklboj  
Managing state is a hard problem. We need to coordinate multiple backends, web workers, and UI components, all of which update the state concurrently. Patterns like Redux make some of this coordination explicit, but they don’t solve the problem completely. It is much broader. What should we store in memory and what in the URL? What about the local UI state? How do we synchronize the persistent state, the URL, and the state on the server? All these questions have to be answered when designing the state management of our applications. In this article I will cover six types of state, the typical mistakes we make managing them in Angular applications, and the patterns we should use instead. 另附：[Angular 2+ Components & Libraries](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-angular-components)

**Introducing redux-query**  
https://amplitude.engineering/introducing-redux-query-7734e7215b3b#.2in08kfq0  
We are excited to share our solution to this problem: redux-query. We think redux-query is a great solution for any React/Redux-based web apps that depend on REST APIs. It lets you store all of your network state inside your existing Redux store with minimal boilerplate and some great features like automatic request cancellation, optimistic updates, response caching and deduplication.

Google的成功有着很多原因, 包括开明的领导力、伟大的人才、超高的招聘标准，以及在迅速成长的市场中成功利用早期领先优势的财务实力。但其中一个原因是Google开发了优秀的软件工程实践，帮助它取得成功。这些做法随着时间的流逝，根据地球上众多最有才华的软件工程师积累和凝练的智慧而演变。我们愿与世界分享我们的实践的经验，包括分享我们从错误中学到的一些教训。本文的目的是梳理并简要介绍Google的关键软件工程实践。然后，其他组织和个人可以将它们与自己的软件工程实践进行比较和对比，并考虑是否自己应用一些实践经验。另附：[在 Google 工作 10 年，到底能学到啥](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5OTA1MDUyMA==&mid=2655437837&idx=1&sn=d9f314efbebf00e77ddf8b574f09553d)

无人驾驶汽车一定会让大量司机失业；在线聊天机器人的发展和数据积累，最终可能会导致客服人员们的失业；以及，大量效率工具的出现也可能会让一部分产品经理和运营失业。机器或许没有真正超越和奴役人类，却在不经意间把大量人类变成了“无用”的存在，从而在另一种意义上开始渐渐凌驾于人类之上。

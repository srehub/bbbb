**Crafting a high-performance TV user interface using React**  
http://techblog.netflix.com/2017/01/crafting-high-performance-tv-user.html  
The Netflix TV interface is constantly evolving as we strive to figure out the best experience for our members. For example, after A/B testing, eye-tracking research, and customer feedback we recently rolled out video previews to help members make better decisions about what to watch. We’ve written before about how our TV application consists of an SDK installed natively on the device, a JavaScript application that can be updated at any time, and a rendering layer known as Gibbon. In this post we’ll highlight some of the strategies we’ve employed along the way to optimize our JavaScript application performance.

**10 Tips to Become a Better Node Developer in 2017**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/10-tips-to-become-a-better-node-developer/  
In this post I’ll outline ten tips to help you become a better Node developer in 2017. These tips come from me, who saw and learned them in the trenches, as well as people who have written the most popular Node and npm modules. Here’s what we’ll be covering.

**Google Infrastructure Security Design Overview**  
https://cloud.google.com/security/security-design/  
This document gives an overview of how security is designed into Google’s technical infrastructure. This global scale infrastructure is designed to provide security through the entire information processing lifecycle at Google. This infrastructure provides secure deployment of services, secure storage of data with end user privacy safeguards, secure communications between services, secure and private communication with customers over the internet, and safe operation by administrators. Google uses this infrastructure to build its internet services, including both consumer services such as Search, Gmail, and Photos, and enterprise services such as G Suite and Google Cloud Platform.

**A Year Without a Byte**  
https://code.flickr.net/2017/01/05/a-year-without-a-byte/  
One of the largest cost drivers in running a service like Flickr is storage. We’ve described multiple techniques to get this cost down over the years: use of COS, creating sizes dynamically on GPUs and perceptual compression. These projects have been very successful, but our storage cost is still significant.
At the beginning of 2016, we challenged ourselves to go further — to go a full year without needing new storage hardware. Using multiple techniques, we got there.

**How Functional Animation Helps Improve User Experience**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/how-functional-animation-helps-improve-user-experience/  
Since humans are visually driven creatures, the impact of imagery only increases with the help of animation. Our eyes innately pay attention to moving objects, and animation is like eye candy — catchy and bright elements that call attention to and help differentiate an app from its competitors. As of late, more and more designers are incorporating animation as a functional element that enhances the user experience. Animation is no longer just for delight; it is one of the most important tools for successful interaction.

**Yarn vs npm - The State of Node.js Package Managers**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/  
With the v7.4 release, npm 4 became the bundled, default package manager for Node.js. In the meantime, Facebook released their own package manager solution, called Yarn. Let's take a look at the state of Node.js package managers, what they can do for you, and when you should pick which one!

**API DESIGN TIPS FOR LIBRARIES**  
http://staltz.com/api-design-tips-for-libraries.html

**Bringing Wide Color to Instagram**  
https://engineering.instagram.com/bringing-wide-color-to-instagram-5a5481802d7d#.a3xk0cyyf  
Last September, Apple announced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which include cameras that capture a greater range of colors than previous models, and screens that can display that wider color range. We’ve just finished updating Instagram to support wide color, and since we’re one of the first major apps to do so, I wanted to share the process of converting the app to help any others doing the conversion.

http://zhenhua-lee.github.io/node/socket.html    
我们处于互联网时代，互联网产品百花齐放。例如，当打开浏览器，可以看到各种信息，浏览器是如何跟服务器进行通信的？当打开微信跟朋友聊天时，你是如何跟朋友进行消息传递的？这些都得靠网络进程之间的通信，都得依赖于socket。那什么是socket？node中有哪些跟网络通信有关的模块？这些问题是本文研究的重点。

**一万字带您走进密码学的世界**  
http://www.ehcoo.com/cryptology1.html  
密码学是研究编制密码和破译密码的技术科学。研究密码变化的客观规律，应用于编制密码以保守通信秘密的，称为编码学；应用于破译密码以获取通信情报的，称为破译学，总称密码学。为了使读者对密码学有一个整体的认识，本文简述了常见的密码学的概念，其中本文包括对称密码、哈希函数、非对称密码，数字签名，数字认证等。

Version 3 doesn’t introduce many new concepts, nor did barely anything change in the core algorithm. But the API has received many improvements. The API is now more coherent, and it paves the path towards a Proxy based Mobx implementation (to be made once all major web browsers support this move).

https://github.com/ramda/ramda  
There are already several excellent libraries with a functional flavor. Typically, they are meant to be general-purpose toolkits, suitable for working in multiple paradigms. Ramda has a more focused goal. We wanted a library designed specifically for a functional programming style, one that makes it easy to create functional pipelines, one that never mutates user data.

**Resilient Web Design**  
https://resilientwebdesign.com/introduction/  
The World Wide Web has been around for long enough now that we can begin to evaluate the twists and turns of its evolution. I wrote this book to highlight some of the approaches to web design that have proven to be resilient. I didn’t do this purely out of historical interest (although I am fascinated by the already rich history of our young industry). In learning from the past, I believe we can better prepare for the future.

**Blender for Hackers - 3D modeling is just like using VIM**  
https://learntemail.sam.today/blog/blender-for-hackers-3d-modeling-is-just-like-using-vim/  
Modeling 3D objects is pretty neat. Whether it is for animating a video or making an interactive program, having some understanding the basics of a 3D program makes it easy to create impressive looking things. Enter Blender - an amazing, FLOSS software package. To me Blender is like VIM, a modal, keyboard driven editor, only 3D. It is so intuitive for developers!

**漩涡中的支付宝，危机感是什么，又如何反思自己**  
http://36kr.com/p/5061919.html  
继续做好支付的创新，不管线上支付还是线下支付，这是支付宝的核心价值。2017年大家会看到我们会更开放，要把更多的基础能力开放出来，跟生态合作伙伴一起去服务于商业和消费者。这些能力包括技术能力、云计算能力、信用能力，风险能力，背后一系列金融的能力，包括用户运营方面的能力，都会积极地向市场尤其是合作伙伴开放。让我们共同期待更好的支付宝。

**这可能将是2017年最引人注目的 IPO**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2-QBd_3MKtuabFCrD8EdOQ  
Dropbox CEO 的这个理念非常棒：“世界上有近20亿知识型员工。我相信，5年后他们使用的工具将不再是他们今天使用的工具”。另外，Atlassian 收购了 Trello，见 [Atlassian + Trello: changing the way teams work](https://blogs.atlassian.com/2017/01/atlassian-plus-trello/)。期待这些致力于改变传统工作方式的公司给办公领域代理的变革。不过 [曾想颠覆 Twitter 的 App.net 正式宣布关闭](http://36kr.com/p/5061960.html)，文中这段话发人深省：看起来美好的东西很少有效，因为商业世界里，人们会自动涌向最好的服务，而最好的服务来源于最好的创业者所构建出来的、最好的商业模式，当一个产品看起来像英雄挑战旧有秩序，那只是因为它还没有机会壮大到成为一个恶人。

**腾讯联合创始人张志东：关于企业如何基业长青 我的内外部思考**  
http://www.chinaventure.com.cn/cmsmodel/news/detail/308074.shtml  
企业基业长青的秘密究竟是什么？张志东从内外部视角谈了谈自己对此的认识，希望能给你带来一些启示。 每个大公司发展背后都离不开良好的企业文化，一家公司不能仅仅为了市场份额和商业利益，而要面向未来，具备更强的社会责任感，传递社会正能量，管理层首先要有这样的坚持。一个优秀的互联网的产品，初心往往都是很朴素的，就是用互联网帮助人们解决一个生活中不爽的问题，让生活更好，而在一个竞争激烈的环境里，在一个大型组织里，团队比较容易迷失，变成了为 KPI，为了做大，为了出名，为了打败竞争对手，当团队把「成为行业第一」，「我要做老大」当成目标， 就容易陷入越做越想「更强大」，缺乏抵御诱惑的能力。

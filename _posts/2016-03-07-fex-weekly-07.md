**InfrastructureAsCode**  
http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InfrastructureAsCode.html  
大神 Martin Fowler 对云计算未来的思考。Infrastructure as code is the approach to defining computing and network infrastructure through source code that can then be treated just like any software system. Such code can be kept in source control to allow auditability and ReproducibleBuilds, subject to testing practices, and the full discipline of ContinuousDelivery. It's an approach that's been used over the last decade to deal with growing CloudComputing platforms and will become the dominant way to handle computing infrastructure in the next.

**How to Deploy Software**  
https://zachholman.com/posts/deploying-software  
Whenever you make a change to your codebase, there's always going to be a risk that you're about to break something.It doesn't have to be as stressful, though. There's one phrase I'm going to be reiterating over and over throughout this whole piece: Your deploys should be as boring, straightforward, and stress-free as possible. 探讨部署这个话题，一篇值得看的长文。

**What’s New in jQuery 3**  
http://developer.telerik.com/featured/whats-new-in-jquery-3/  
Many people state that jQuery is dead and it doesn’t have a place in modern web development anymore. However, its development continues and statistics of its adoption (78.5% in the top million) contradict these claims. In this article, I’ve walked you through the main changes that jQuery 3 will feature. 另附：[A love letter to jQuery](http://madebymike.com.au/writing/love-letter-to-jquery/)

**Rules For Structuring (Redux) Applications**  
http://jaysoo.ca/2016/02/28/organizing-redux-application/  
As our applications grow, we often find that file structure and organization to be crucial for the mainability of application code. What I want to do in this post is to present three organizational rules that I personally follow on my own projects. By following the rules, your application code should be easier to reason about, and you will find yourself wasting less time on file navigation, tedious refactoring, and bug fixes.

**The New Web Typography**  
https://robinrendle.com/essays/new-web-typography/  
We can trace a nervous path through the links and hearts that occupy our timelines. In search of answers, we’ve peeked under the covers of Material Design and examined hundreds of pattern libraries, since one of them might be secretly withholding the principles of good design within. But why are we obsessed with typographic rules? And if we were to make guidelines for setting text on the web, what form should those rules take?

The history of Arduino has been told by many people, and no two stories match.

**Website scraping using Selenium, Docker and Chrome with Extensions**  
https://www.webcodegeeks.com/web-development/website-scraping-using-selenium-docker-chrome-extensions/  
For a specific project we needed a quick way to get the content of a specific URL and check whether a word was present in the text there. If all we had to scrape were static websites, this wouldn’t be that difficult. We would just get the sources, parse them with jsoup and extract the readable content. However, a large percentage of the target sites, are single page apps or angular applications, which only show the content after some javascript processing. So we started looking at an alternative way to do this.

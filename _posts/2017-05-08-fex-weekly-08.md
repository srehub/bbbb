**Prepack**  
https://prepack.io/  
Prepack is a tool that optimizes JavaScript source code: Computations that can be done at compile-time instead of run-time get eliminated. Prepack replaces the global code of a JavaScript bundle with equivalent code that is a simple sequence of assignments. This gets rid of most intermediate computations and object allocations. 附：[prepack-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/gajus/prepack-webpack-plugin).

**Elements of JavaScript Style**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/elements-of-javascript-style-caa8821cb99f  
The following are guidelines, not immutable laws. There may be valid reasons to deviate from them if doing so clarifies the meaning of the code, but be vigilant and self-aware. These guidelines have stood the test of time for good reason: They’re usually right.

**Glossary of Modern JavaScript Concepts: Part 2**  
https://auth0.com/blog/glossary-of-modern-javascript-concepts-part-2/  
In [the first part of the Glossary of Modern JS Concepts](https://auth0.com/blog/glossary-of-modern-javascript-concepts/) series, we learned about functional, reactive, and functional reactive programming. In Part 2, we'll gain an understanding of concepts like scope, closures, tree shaking, components, and more, as well as JavaScript application topics such as data flow and change detection.

**Why I’m Moving on to Web Components and Not Looking Back**  
https://hackernoon.com/why-im-moving-on-to-web-components-and-not-looking-back-aa8028c99c83  
Certainly it will take a few more years before large companies are comfortable taking the plunge and ending support for users that have not updated their web browsers. But a truly wonderful world awaits when they do. I hope I am correct in predicting that the complexity and code proliferation in web development, after increasing for many years, is about to take a nose dive. The features that these libraries and frameworks provide have arrived in the “operating system” itself — the web browser. No pre-processors now. Just code.

**Energizing Atom with V8's custom start-up snapshot**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2017/05/energizing-atom-with-v8s-custom-start.html  
Native Electron apps, including Atom, leverage Chromium to display a GUI and Node.js as an execution environment, both of which respectively embed V8 to run JavaScript. This allows Electron apps to take advantage of V8 snapshots to quickly initialize a previously serialized heap for faster startup. Electron developers have even released electron-link, a convenience library for setting up this feature, which Atom heavily relies on for its performance optimizations.

**Nest - Node.js framework built on top of TypeScript**  
https://kamilmysliwiec.com/nest-final-release-is-here-node-js-framework-built-top-of-typescript  
Nest is a powerful web framework for Node.js, which helps you effortlessly build efficient, scalable applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript and combines best concepts of both OOP (Object Oriented Progamming) and FP (Functional Programming).

**支付宝前端构建工具的发展和未来的选择**

下文说说我理解的支付宝前端构建工具发展史，从 spm 到 ant tool，再到未来我们可能会走的路。

**V8 Ignition：JS 引擎与字节码的不解之缘**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/26669846  
很多 JS 引擎都是采用了字节码这一脚本语言实现技术的，而 v8 一枝独秀，走“纯机器码”路线，其实过于激进了：虽然执行性能上可以登峰造极，但却带来了内存占用过大的问题。这次引入字节码实则是做了工程上的恰当取舍，将损失掉的内存找回来，更加符合如今移动和嵌入式设备为主的应用场景；以时间换空间，让 v8 能更好的服务于低内存的设备。如今 V8 也回到了字节码的怀抱，不禁令人感叹 JS 引擎与字节码真是有着不解之缘！这个专栏还有很多 Node 及 V8 相关的资料，感兴趣的可以关注。

**企业的应用架构到底该怎么演变才能合了CEO的愿**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5Nzc4OTA1Mw==&mid=2659599230&idx=1&sn=cbf97ea56f956e23b3529ea81551b23c

**Building Express Backbone: Facebook’s new long-haul network**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/1782709872057497/building-express-backbone-facebook-s-new-long-haul-network/  
As new data centers were being built, we realized the need to split the cross-data center vs Internet-facing traffic into different networks and optimize them individually. In a less than a year, we built the first version of our new cross-data center backbone network, called the Express Backbone (EBB), and we've been growing it ever since.

**Deploy with haste: the story of rig**  
https://tech.buzzfeed.com/deploy-with-haste-the-story-of-rig-ca9a58b5719a  
This is a tale of infrastructure evolution. In the span of 12 months, we went from large, release-oriented deploys to an architecture and approach that enabled 150+ deploys a day. Getting there wasn’t easy, but we learned a lot along the way…

With Dropbox’s document scanner, a user can take a photo of a document with their phone and convert it into a clean, rectangular PDF. In our previous blog posts (Part 1, Part 2), we presented an overview of document scanner’s machine learning backend, along with its iOS implementation. This post will describe some of technical challenges associated with implementing the document scanner on Android.

**How to Get into VR**  
https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-get-into-vr/

**Designing Voice Experiences**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/designing-voice-experiences/  
Voice-based interfaces are becoming commonplace. A new interface does not mean that we have to disregard everything we have successfully applied to previous interfaces; we will need to adapt our process for the nuances of voice-driven interfaces, including conversational interactions and the lack of a screen. We will look at how a typical genie in a bottle works, discuss the steps involved in designing voice experiences, and illustrate these steps by designing a voice app for Alexa.

**Programming as a Way of Thinking**  
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/programming-as-a-way-of-thinking/  
Modern programming languages are qualitatively different from their predecessors, but we are only beginning to realize the implications of that difference.  In a [companion article](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2017/04/python-as-way-of-thinking.html), I present more ways to use Python to think, explore, learn, and teach.

**SQL is 43 years old - here’s 8 reasons we still use it today**  
http://blog.sqlizer.io/posts/sql-43/  
The simple fact that both arrived early in the life of computing, and that for 90% of the time they just work, means databases have become a ‘solved problem’ you no longer need to think about. But people do use other other email automation software and payment solutions, just like people use NoSQL databases. Yet even with other database technology available, albeit less mature technology, SQL still reigns and reigns well. So, finally, here are 8 reasons we still use SQL 43 years after it was first cooked up.

**[译]四五十岁之后，还在编程的程序员都有谁**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2650996096&idx=1&sn=e698467a16d3842c891b477d5e3d846f  
关于程序员是不是吃青春饭的讨论由来已久，对于那些步入中年的程序员来说，似乎不转管理岗就会被富有活力的年轻程序员替代。但总有些顶级的软件开发者，不愿意从事管理岗位，仍然活跃在一线写着代码。

**什么是好产品？**

什么是产品？你必须先把公司里那些描述产品的功能定义、模块素描的文档统统清零。抛开这些表面，跟着李明远好好琢磨琢磨：产品的本质，到底是个什么东西。真正的产品，是去满足用户需求痛点、给用户创造快感，或者成本节约带来的感受。这种感受既可感知，也有可能不可感知。

**Google's Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MTEyNjQ3MA==&mid=2649690429&idx=1&sn=281dc030fa9bdf5d3b8fd1c5a83b06eb  
Google 翻译的水平真的越来越高，一篇英文技术文章，Google 翻译后的结果已经基本可以看懂了。身为码农，请不要再找借口说英文不好看不懂英文文档了。

**The State of JavaScript – Survey results**  
http://stateofjs.com/2016/introduction/  
Over nine thousand developers took part in the first edition of the State Of JavaScript survey. They answered questions on topics ranging from front-end frameworks and state management, to build tools and testing libraries. You'll find out which libraries developers most want to learn next, and which have the highest satisfaction ratings. And hopefully, this data will help you make sense of the ever-changing JavaScript ecosystem.

**Angular 2 vs React: The Ultimate Dance Off**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/angular-2-vs-react-the-ultimate-dance-off-60e7dfbc379c#.bf5ulsw5p  
Most people who follow me know that I personally favor React, but of course I like my decisions to be educated, not based on uninformed bias. Lately, I’ve been exploring Angular 2 in-depth. Here’s how it compares to React in my opinion.

**Why I'm not a React Native Developer**  
https://arielelkin.github.io/articles/why-im-not-a-react-native-developer  
Many people are currently assessing React Native as a platform to develop their next mobile app on. This is no trivial matter. Having spent several months using React Native, I have found that it is neither a platform I would develop in, nor a platform I would recommend the use of. This article proposes to provide a more thorough evaluation of the pros and cons of switching from Swift development to React Native, and will argue against the switch. 回应文：[Why I'm a React Native Developer: a Response to Ariel Elkin](https://codecookbook.co/text/why-im-a-react-native-developer/)

**Next Generation Server Compression With Brotli**

A new kid on the block has been gaining support in modern browsers, and its name is Brotli. In this article, you’ll get hands-on with Brotli by writing a Node.js-powered HTTP server that implements this new algorithm, and we’ll compare its performance to gzip.

**Modern Functional Programming**  
http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp-part-2  
http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp  
Late last year, I wrote my thoughts on what the architecture of modern functional programs should look like. Since then, I’ve had a chance to read responses, look at equivalent architectures built upon Monad Transformers Library (MTL), and even talk about my recent experiments at LambdaConf 2016. The result is a sequel to my original post, which consists of a newly-minted, tricked-out recommendation for architecting modern functional programs, along with new ways of thinking about the structure of this architecture.

**代码命名：僧敲月下门**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NDM0ODQwMw==&mid=2649827483&idx=1&sn=228be8c6c3448a56f7ecd00e20e3ae1d  
可不要小看源代码结构、类名、方法名、变量名，它们往往体现着你对系统和业务的理解，勾勒出了系统的骨架，也是工程师交流的渠道。一个程序员的代码反映其能力，而一个程序员给代码命名的水准则反映其修为和内涵。

**[译]大型前端项目的架构**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MTA1MjAxMQ==&mid=2651223189&idx=1&sn=dcb163a56164bbc61dfc6784de20c766  
当在开发你的大型应用架构时，很重要的一点是多想远一点，不知是一个月或一年后，可能是更远。我知道很难猜测未来的发展，但还是有一些空间可以想象。文中给出了了三个典型原则：打造大型应用的诀窍不是在打造一型应用，而是将你的应用拆解成许多小的组件，然后再把他们组成你的应用；因为刚开始就无法预知这个应用未来的发展趋势，所以就坦然接受在不知道任合条件的情況下开始你的设计，这个时候你就会花时间在考虑某些关键模块是否会在将来更变上；组件之间的耦合性很高，其可重用性便低，而且很难再设计变更后却不影响到其他组件的运行。

**Methods for Controlling Spacing in Web Typography**  
https://css-tricks.com/methods-controlling-spacing-web-typography/  
Typography on the web is hard! Yes, we do have a ton of control over how type is displayed, rendered and positioned on the screen. But with great power comes great responsibility. At least you now have a few tools at your disposal to respond back to web designers who are stuck on the the precision of typographical design in the browser. 相关文章

**安卓自定义View进阶-事件分发机制原理**  
http://www.gcssloop.com/customview/dispatch-touchevent-theory  
安卓上面的View是树形结构的，View可能会重叠在一起，当我们点击的地方有多个View都可以响应的时候，这个点击事件应该给谁呢？为了解决这一个问题，就有了事件分发机制。View的事件分发机制实际上就是一个非常经典的责任链模式，如果你了解责任链模式，那么事件分发对你来说并不是什么难题，如果你不了解责任链模式，刚好借此机会学习一下啦。

**Reflections of an "Old" Programmer**  
http://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2016/reflections-of-an-old-programmer.php  
一位 40 岁的程序员的思考，这几个观点挺不错的：knowledge decay, Half of what a programmer knows will be useless in 10 years; knowledge accumulation rate, the pace at which we add new things to our knowledge corpus; take the long view, making less money in the short term (at a better employer) will yield more money (and stability) over the course of a long career; invest most in knowledge that is durable, spent accumulating knowledge that has a longer half-life - algorithms, application security, performance optimization, and architecture.

**TypeScript - The Myth of the Superset**  
http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2016/10/myth-of-superset.html  
TypeScript claims to be a superset of JavaScript. Many TypeScript presentations start with a picture of concentrical circles illustrating that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This fact is a major value proposition of TypeScript over other “Compile-to-JavaScript” languages. It is the base for a gradual migration of a legacy project to TypeScript and it is the base for a frictionless integration with the JavaScript ecosystem.

**技术的执念**  
http://insights.thoughtworkers.org/obsession-og-technology/  
技术人员有时候会有一种想要把所有技术都掌握的「执念」，这在局外人来看是一种荒诞不经的想法，但是置身其中，你很难看出这一点。在知识规模如此巨大的今天，一个人是无法掌握所有技术的，更不用说新的技术还在不断的涌现出来！这就要求我们有节制的来聚焦在某些技术上，而视其他技术如无物。实践中，首先要令自己相信：你无法掌握所有的知识，即使仅仅在软件开发领域。有了这个大前提之后，你只需要采取先建立广度，再建立深度的原则即可。
